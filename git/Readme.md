1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:14,930
And this video continue learning about as your divorce and specifically we are going to create a project

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:22,370
inside an organization, so far we have seen what is divorce and how you can create an organization.

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,450
We will continue here creating a project inside an organization, but before that we should know some

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,490
keywords, some terminologies.

5
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,550
So let's understand some terminologies and then we will continue creating a project.

6
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:46,820
They should blow about as your day services, so we are going to see some services like boards that

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:53,270
is used to track work, then we are going to see about pipelines, which is helpful to build and deploy

8
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,080
the application.

9
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:02,480
Ripples, that is cloud based source control test plans, this is used to test apps.

10
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,110
We are going to see all these terminologies in the dashboard.

11
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,590
Next thing is integration and extension, this is also a service and you can integrate as the audio

12
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:23,240
ops with many applications like Trello can file GitHub and many more will continue signing into your

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,230
Daubs dashboard.

14
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:33,650
Here we have an organization, we are going to create a project inside it and call it Project Abargil,

15
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,090
you can put a description any any description you want to have.

16
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,770
A project to reply, simple application.

17
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,400
Then you can set the visibility to either public or private.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,530
For public.

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,930
The FBC are not supporting, so it is also kind of poison control.

20
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,420
They are going to see shortly.

21
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,290
For now we are going to select private and taken at once here.

22
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,220
We are going to select poison control.

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,940
The default is get and as you see, it has been Fondation was in control, which is DFAC, and if you

24
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,260
select public, then this DFAC won't be supported.

25
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,230
For this drama, we will continue with get.

26
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,970
Next thing is work a -- process.

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:36,140
Work item process has for different things like basic agile scrum and KMA mean you can see the details

28
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,240
in the documentation.

29
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:45,440
So here is the official documentation of the office and you can choose the model depending on your requirements.

30
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,300
For now, we are going to go with the basic one so you can go through it and select it accordingly.

31
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,020
But for the learning purpose.

32
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,690
As of now, we are going to continue with the basic one.

33
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,520
So after selecting Basic from here, click on Create Project.

34
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:16,500
Here is the project dashboard, and as you can see, it has project name and the different services

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,480
like board proposed pipelines, test plants, defects, effects, ADC.

36
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,120
All these terminologies are present here, which is why it was necessary to know about this will go

37
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,340
in details about these services.

38
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:40,010
This is our project, which we have created for you to get your hands dirty by creating these things

39
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,620
as you are learning through the course.
